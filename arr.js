// Given a non-empty array of integers nums. Every element appears twice except for ine. Find that single one.
// Follow up-- could you implement a solution with a linear runtine complexity and without using extra memory
// Pseudocode
// you can loop once and achieve linear runtime O(n). Cannot loop inside loop
// Cannot use object to store frequency as it would use O(n) space. need O(1)
const arr = [2, 2, 1];
const arr2 = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2];
